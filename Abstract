The current information gives an idea regarding the Tracking of vessels and monitoring the encroachments at Cochin Port using Drones. Majorly the issues addressed to be Tracking and reporting of harbor crafts like boats, barges, dinghies, etc., that ply in the port area limit and Encroachments if any, in the port limits need to be watched constantly and report the same. The drone contains various sensors to check the position, name, and type of vessel within a harbor. This is a solution designed to keep track of crafts that are plying in the port area along with the management of maritime activities within and around ports. The drone will run with ArduPilot which is an open source, unmanned vehicle autopilot software suite. With the help of image processing the drone captures the pictures of vessels and gets the data from vessels using AIS technology. The OCR technology is used to read the text or characters on vessels to identify that ship. Encroachments are monitored by drones overflying the port boundaries that can be tracked via GPS tags. Many tools are included for hardware execution to keep track of vessels at ports and libraries like TensorFlow, DJI Tello, OpenCV etc., are for training the model to recognize vessels at port and controlling of drone.
